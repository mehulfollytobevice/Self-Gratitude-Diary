# Self-Gratitude-Diary

It’s no secret that showing gratitude is good for you. As well as being backed by science, leaders such as the Dalai Lama are also big fans, so it’s no wonder that more of us are taking the time to be thankful for what we have in our lives. One of the best ways to show thankfulness on a daily basis is to keep a gratitude journal. 

While regular journaling has been proven to improve your well-being, making a point of jotting down all the things that you are grateful for can take the experience to a whole new level. Keeping a gratitude journal is easy and on the simplest level it involves making a note of the things that you are grateful for that day. You can decide how long your list is each day and how much detail you want to go into. The great thing is that it’s an easy habit to form and after a while, you are left with a collection of inspiring material to look back on when you are in need of a pick-me-up.

“Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.” – Melody Beattie
